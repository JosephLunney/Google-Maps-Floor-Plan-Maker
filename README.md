# Google-Maps-Floor-Plan-Maker
This uses the Google Maps API to implement a simple floor plan maker. 

First and foremost, thank you so much for taking your time to look at my project!

The floor plan maker creates a graph based on the floor plan created by the user and then uses 
Dijkstra's algorithm to draw paths from within the building. 

Content (What I learned) includes:
-Dijkstra's algorithm
-Google maps JS API
-Calculating whether a point is in a retangle on the equitorial plane 
-Calculating whether two rectangles overlap 
-Creating my first nodal graph
