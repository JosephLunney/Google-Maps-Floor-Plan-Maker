# Google-Maps-Floor-Plan-Maker
This uses the Google Maps API to implement a simple floor plan maker. 

First and foremost, thank you so much for taking your time to look at my project!

The floor plan maker creates a nodal graph based on the floor plan creates by the user and then uses 
Dijkstra's algorithm to draw paths from within the building.
